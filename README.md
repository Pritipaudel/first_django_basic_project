This is a basic Django project created as part of my learning journey to understand Django web development. This project serves as an introduction to Django and showcases some of the essential features like models, views, and templates.

Features

- Basic Django setup: This project sets up a simple Django application with models and views.
- Form handling: The project includes basic form handling and renders the form via HTML templates.
- Database integration: It connects to a local database (SQLite by default) and demonstrates how to interact with models.
